/**
 * Request Body Integrity (spec "Request Body Integrity (Digest Header)"): binds
 * a request body to its HTTP Signature via the `Digest` header. Two hooks,
 * installed by every route group alongside the auth hooks:
 *
 * - `captureRawBody` (preParsing) reads a JSON/text body in full, bounded by
 *   the route's `bodyLimit`, and keeps the exact bytes on `request.rawBody`
 *   while handing the same bytes to Fastify's parser, so the digest can be
 *   recomputed against what the client actually signed. Re-serializing the parsed body is
 *   not guaranteed byte-identical, so we keep the raw bytes instead. Streamed
 *   bodies (multipart uploads, tar imports, raw blobs) are not buffered; instead
 *   they pass through a hashing transform that verifies the `Digest`
 *   incrementally at end-of-stream, so large/binary uploads keep streaming yet
 *   are still bound to the signature.
 * - `verifyBodyDigest` (preValidation) enforces, for any request carrying a
 *   `Content-Type`: that the signature covers the `digest` header (MUST), that a
 *   `Digest` header is present, and -- when the raw body was captured --
 *   independently recomputes the body digest and compares it (SHOULD). A
 *   missing, malformed, uncovered, or non-matching digest is rejected with
 *   `invalid-authorization-header` (400).
