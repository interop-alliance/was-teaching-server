/**
 * PostgreSQL schema for the `PostgresBackend`: an ordered list of migrations
 * (SQL scripts, and one step that checks the data before it reshapes the
 * schema) plus the tiny hand-rolled runner that applies them idempotently
 * (inside an advisory-locked transaction) on backend `open()`. The whole
 * schema is readable in this one file; there is no external migration tool.
 *
 * Collation note: every identifier or ISO-8601 timestamp column that
 * participates in an `ORDER BY` or keyset `>` comparison is declared
 * `COLLATE "C"` (byte order, which for UTF-8 is code-point order) so Postgres
 * ordering agrees with the JS code-unit comparisons the filesystem backend and
 * the pagination cursors use. (The two orders could theoretically diverge for
 * supplementary-plane characters -- unreachable here because the request layer
 * validates ids as URL-safe ASCII.) Timestamps are stored as the fixed-width
 * ISO-8601 strings the wire model uses (`new Date().toISOString()`), not
 * `timestamptz`, so they round-trip byte-identically. A write stamp's
 * `updatedAt` is the ISO string of its hybrid-logical-clock millisecond, so
 * the text column holds that millisecond exactly.
