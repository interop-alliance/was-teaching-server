   * `afterPosition`, in ascending feed position order, capped at `limit` (a
   * backend MAY reduce an oversized value to its own maximum). With no
   * `afterPosition`, the feed starts from the beginning.
   *
   * The feed carries every record kind in the Collection, each document
   * discriminated on `kind` (see `FeedDocument`). A `resource` document is a
   * Resource or its tombstone, whatever its content type: JSON, binary, and
   * `text/jsonl` (a `did.jsonl` history log) alike, each with its stored
   * `contentType`. Only a live JSON Resource carries `data`. A
   * `collection-metadata` document is the Collection Metadata object, and a
   * `log` document is the Collection's governing history log. Each appears
   * once, at the position of its latest write, and reports the record's
   * current state.
   *
   * The feed position is a per-Collection sequence, a positive integer
   * starting at 1. Every Resource-level write in the Collection takes the
   * next one: a content write, a metadata write, a soft delete, and a
   * Resource written by an import. So does a Collection Metadata write (a
   * create, by import too, and an update), a governed-log write (the
   * guarded create and each append; a byte-identical log write writes
   * nothing and takes none), and a write or delete of the Collection's own
   * policy or a Resource policy (a Space policy is in no Collection's feed).
   * A log write advances the Collection Metadata object's local validator
   * segment without taking a position for it, so the `collection-metadata`
   * document can carry a newer local segment than the one at its position. A chunk write takes none, so it never moves its
   * parent Resource. The backend assigns the position inside the
   * per-Collection critical section that makes the write visible to this
   * method, so no write can land at or before a position already returned.
   * Positions are unique within a Collection, across kinds, but need not be
   * contiguous. A position is one server's fact about its own feed: it is
   * never exported or replicated, and an import assigns fresh ones. A record
   * stored before feed positions existed has none and is absent from the
   * feed until it is rewritten. The request layer wraps the position in the
   * opaque wire checkpoint; a backend never sees that string.
   *
   * The counter has a generation, minted with the first position it hands
   * out and kept for the Collection's life. It is removed with the
   * Collection, so a Collection re-created under the same id, by hand or by
   * an import, restarts at 1 under a fresh one. The result's `feedGeneration`
   * is that generation, absent while the Collection has handed out no
   * position. The request layer puts it in the checkpoint and refuses a
   * checkpoint that carries another, so a reader holding one from before a
   * re-create restarts rather than skipping the new feed's first positions.
   *
   * Each document carries the record's write stamp (`updatedAt`,
   * `updatedAtCounter`, `originId`) and, out of band, the record's
   * `validator`, which the request layer formats as the wire `etag`. A
   * `resource` document's stamp and validator are its content record's. It
   * also carries the `/meta` record's stamp and generation as `meta` (when a
   * metadata write has occurred) with its `metaValidator` (composed with
   * `validator` into the wire `metaEtag`), the server-managed `createdBy` (the creator's DID, when one
   * was recorded -- so provenance replicates and does not have to be fetched
   * per Resource from `/meta`), and -- so metadata replicates alongside
   * content -- the user-writable `custom` object (the opaque encryption
   * envelope on an encrypted Collection). The validators are the quoted
   * strong validators a replica can send back as `If-Match` without a GET
   * per record. A tombstone keeps its `createdBy`, as it keeps its
   * `createdAt`. A metadata-only edit re-surfaces the Resource at a new feed
   * position, with a new `meta` stamp but its content stamp and `data`
   * unchanged. The stamps have no ordering role in the feed, which is
   * ordered by feed position. A tombstone (soft-deleted Resource) is
   * surfaced with `deleted: true`, its last-known `contentType`, and no
   * `data`, so the delete replicates until clients catch up. Each document
   * carries its `feedPosition`. The result's `checkpoint` is the last
   * returned document's feed position (what a follow-up call passes as
   * `afterPosition`), or `null` when nothing changed since `afterPosition`.
   *
