/**
 * Shared composition of a Collection Metadata object from a request body, for
 * the two writes that carry one: Create Collection (`POST /space/:spaceId/`)
 * and Update (or Create by Id) Collection (`PUT /space/:spaceId/:collectionId/meta`).
 * Both take the merged object -- the configuration members beside the
 * annotation members `custom` and `epoch` -- and both are a full replacement
 * (spec "Update (or Create by Id) Collection"): a writable member the request
 * omits is cleared, except where the spec says otherwise (see
 * `composeCollectionMetadata`).
 *
 * The work is split in two on the same boundary every handler keeps: the
 * shape check runs before authorization (a malformed body is a 400 whoever
 * sends it; `parseCollectionMetadataBody` in `lib/collectionMetadataBody.ts`,
 * which Import Space shares), while the checks that read Space or Collection
 * state -- the backend allowlist, the encryption and revisions transitions,
 * the `custom` envelope -- run after it, so their 409/422 are observable only
 * to an authorized caller.

/**
 * Composes the Collection Metadata object a write persists, from the parsed
 * body and the Collection's current state. Runs after authorization. The
 * rules, in order:
 *
 * - `id` is the URL's (or the body's, on Create Collection); `type` is
 *   `['Collection']`.
 * - `backend` is validated against the Space's backends-available (bad shape
 *   400, unknown id 409). A create with none gets the server default; an
 *   update with none keeps the stored selection (spec "Update (or Create by
 *   Id) Collection").
 * - `encryption`: a direct write on a log-governed Collection is refused
 *   (`encryption-history-log-governed`, 409). Otherwise the descriptor is
 *   set-once: an omitted member on an encrypted Collection is an attempt to
 *   clear it, `encryption-immutable` (409), as is any narrowing change.
 * - `revisions`: `resolution` and `immutable` are declared by the create and
 *   immutable afterward, so an update that adds, drops, or changes one is
 *   refused (`revisions-immutable`, 409); `merge` follows the body. On a
 *   log-governed Collection the log holds the descriptor: a body `revisions`
 *   is checked against the derived one and not stored, a `merge` that differs
 *   from the derived one is refused (`revisions-immutable`, 409), and the
 *   stored descriptor is carried forward untouched.
 * - `plaintext` and `generator` are the spec's carve-outs from clearing: an
 *   omitted member leaves the stored one untouched, and a supplied one
 *   replaces it whole. The result may not carry both `plaintext` and
 *   `encryption` (400).
 * - `name` and `epoch` are taken from the body alone: omitted means cleared. A create with no `name` gets the Collection
 *   id as its name.
 * - `custom`, when present, is the plaintext `{ name, tags }` object or, on an
 *   encrypted Collection, a conforming envelope (422 otherwise). An omitted
 *   `custom` is the cleared state on either kind of Collection and is never
 *   judged as an envelope, so a Collection born with no annotations stays
 *   writable without minting one.
 *
 * @param options {object}
 * @param options.request {FastifyRequest}   supplies `request.server`
 * @param options.spaceId {string}

 * @param [options.existing] {CollectionMetadata}   the stored object, on an
