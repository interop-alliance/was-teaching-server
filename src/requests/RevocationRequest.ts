/**
 * Request handlers for zcap revocation, one per route family:
 * - POST /kms/keystores/:keystoreId/zcaps/revocations/:revocationId
 * - POST /space/:spaceId/zcaps/revocations/:revocationId
 *
 * Both share one submission flow (`submitRevocation`), differing only in the
 * scope the revocation aggregates under -- a keystore or a Space -- the action
 * the invocation must carry (the webkms `write` vs the WAS route families'
 * HTTP verb), and the `/kms` delegation policy the WAS families do not impose.
 *
 * The wire contract is protocol-fixed by ezcap-express's
 * `authorizeZcapRevocation` / `@interop/webkms-client` (the conformance
 * suite): `:revocationId` is the to-be-revoked capability's id, URL-encoded;
 * the body is that capability, verbatim; success is 204 with no body. The
 * submission is authorized under the dual-root rule -- an invocation rooted
 * in the scope, or in the revocation URL itself, whose synthesized root is
 * controlled by every controller in the to-be-revoked capability's (fully
 * verified) chain -- so a delegee can revoke its own zcap without holding a
 * separate capability. Root zcaps cannot be revoked. The stored revocation is
 * consulted by the chain-inspection hook on every subsequent verification
 * rooted in that scope (`lib/revocations.ts`).

 * is revoked), and that ordering is what lets the store hit carry a problem
 * type of its own -- every other 400 (malformed body, root capability, id
 * mismatch, a chain that does not verify) stays `InvalidRevocationError`, so a
