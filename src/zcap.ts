/**
 * ZCap verification: handleZcapVerify() checks the capability-invocation
 * signature against the Space controller's Ed25519 key, synthesizing the root
 * capability via the document loader. Also home to the zcap *revocation*
 * verification pair, shared by the `/kms` and WAS route families:
 * verifyRevocationChain() validates a to-be-revoked capability's delegation
 * chain, and handleRevocationInvocationVerify() authorizes the submission
 * under the dual-root rule (the scope's root -- a keystore or a Space -- or
 * the revocation URL's own root controlled by any chain participant --
 * ezcap-express's `authorizeZcapRevocation` convention).
 *
 * A Space's controller is normally a `did:key`, resolved by the did:key driver.
 * On a Space promoted to a self-hosted `did:webvh` controller, both the
 * signature keyId and the jsigs purpose check resolve instead through
 * `lib/webvhController.ts`, which verifies the DID's history log out of local
 * storage. The log's location comes from the DID string itself, so it may live
 * in a Collection of a Space other than the one being invoked on. That branch
 * is engaged per verification (never module-global), on every verification
 * the request layer supplies a resolver context to, since a delegated link may
 * be signed by a `did:webvh` method on a `did:key`-controlled Space.
 *
 * A `did:webvh` on a replication peer's host whose log a replica
 * registration copies here resolves from that copy, through the same local
 * resolver (`lib/webvhLogLocation.ts`).
 *
 * A foreign `did:webvh` with no stored log -- a peer server's own DID, or a
 * service's or agent's DID on any host, under any path -- is resolved over
 * the network, as the invoker of a delegated capability on the WAS routes.
 * The HTTP-signature verifier resolves the invoker's key before it reads the
 * capability, so `handleZcapVerify` first verifies the embedded delegation
 * chain without that key ({@link peerInvokerGrant}). Only a chain that
 * verifies to the Space controller, and whose invoked capability names the
 * DID as its controller, lets the verification that follows fetch that one
 * DID's log (`lib/peerWebvh.ts`), and only when the operator's blocklist does
 * not name the DID or its host.
