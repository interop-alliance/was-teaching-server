/**
 * Import Space's gate on archived zcap revocation records. An archive's
 * `revocations/` entries are installed in the destination Space's revocation
 * store one by one, after the rest of the archive is written, and each only
 * when two checks pass. The record's capability chain verifies under the
 * destination Space, through the same `verifyRevocationChain` the revocation
 * route runs. And the import's own invocation could have submitted that
 * revocation on the route: a root invocation by the Space controller, an
 * invoker the chain names as a controller, or a delegated capability that
 * reaches the revocation URL with `POST`. The record's `meta` is then rebuilt
 * server-side, so nothing the archive says about the delegator, the scope, or
 * the GC horizon is stored.
 *
 * A record that fails either check is skipped, and the import goes on. A
 * revocation is a fact about a chain rooted in a Space URL. A chain that does
 * not root in the destination Space could not be invoked there, so its
 * revocation is moot. An unverifiable record is also what a forged archive
 * would carry, and a revocation cannot be undone. Without the second check a
 * holder of any import grant could revoke another party's genuine capability
 * by packing its public document into an archive.
 *
 * The gate runs after the backend's `importSpace`, since a chain may carry a
 * link signed by a `did:webvh` whose history log the archive itself restores.
