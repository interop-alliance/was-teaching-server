/**
 * The write rule for a `did.jsonl` Resource, the history log a self-hosted
 * `did:webvh` resolves from. The log is the authorization root of any Space
 * its DID controls, and the Collection it lives in is whatever the DID names,
 * so the rule keys on the Resource name in every Collection. A PUT must
 * fast-forward the stored log: the stored bytes verbatim, followed by any new
 * entries. So a write grant can add history but cannot erase it. Without the
 * rule, a retired client still holding a subtree grant could PUT a prefix of
 * the log that lists its key again, since every prefix of a valid log is a
 * valid log with the same SCID. An append must also verify: the whole new
 * body is verified as the history log of the DID the stored log names, so a
 * junk or tampered entry is refused before it can leave that DID's Spaces
 * with no resolvable controller. A DELETE is refused in the handler; the log
 * goes away only with its Collection or Space.

/**
 * Applies the fast-forward rule to a `did.jsonl` write, before the write.
 * Reads the stored log and its `ETag`, evaluates the client's own
 * preconditions against that read, checks the incoming bytes extend it, and
 * verifies the extended log. Returns the input to write (a streamed body is
 * re-assembled after it was read) and the preconditions to write under:
 * `If-Match` on the `ETag` that was read, or `If-None-Match: *` when no log was stored. The
 * backend evaluates those atomically with the write, so a log that changed
 * after the read fails the write with 412 rather than being overwritten.
 *
 * Throws `precondition-failed` (412) when the body does not extend the
 * stored log, or when the client's preconditions do not hold,
 * `invalid-request-body` (400) when the extended log does not verify, and
 * `payload-too-large` (413) when a streamed body exceeds the route's
 * buffered-body limit.
