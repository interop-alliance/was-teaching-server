 * The rules a storage backend applies a replicated record by. A pull loop
 * (`src/sync/`) reads a record from a peer and hands it to one of the
 * backend's `apply*` methods, which stores it after one comparison of write
 * stamps. Both backends decide through the functions here, so they cannot
 * drift on what is applied, skipped, or refused.
 *
 * A record is applied when its stamp sorts above the held one, by
 * `(ms, counter, originId)`. An equal or lower stamp is skipped, which is
 * also what stops a record a server pulled from being pulled back. Three
 * records follow other rules. A history log fast-forwards. A Collection
 * tombstone removes every life of the Collection created before it, whatever
 * the stamps of its members. Two lives of one Collection id are ordered by
 * their creating stamps.
