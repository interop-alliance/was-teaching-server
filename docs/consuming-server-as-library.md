# Consuming the Server as a Library

Besides running standalone, this package can be consumed as a dependency: the
whole WAS protocol surface (the WAS route groups, the WebKMS `/kms` facet, the
auth/digest hook chains, zcap verification, and the error handler) is exposed as
a single registerable Fastify plugin, `fastifyWas`. A downstream server composes
its own Fastify instance -- its own persistence, security plugins, and
operational endpoints -- and registers `fastifyWas` to speak the exact same wire
protocol as the teaching server. (The rationale and the upstream/downstream
split are described in the production roadmap's "Two-codebase strategy"
section.)

## Install

```bash
pnpm add was-teaching-server    # or: npm install was-teaching-server
```

The package is ESM-only (`"type": "module"`) and requires Node.js >= 24. Two
entry points are importable. The package root carries the server. The
`was-teaching-server/testing` subpath carries test support (see
[Testing against the server](#testing-against-the-server)). The `exports` map
does not expose deep `dist/...` paths.

## What the package exports

| Export                         | What it is                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fastifyWas`                   | The WAS protocol surface as a Fastify plugin                                        |
| `FastifyWasOptions`            | The plugin's options type (see below)                                               |
| `createApp`                    | The teaching server's own composition, as a factory                                 |
| `FileSystemBackend`            | The reference persistence backend (JSON + blobs on disk)                            |
| `PostgresBackend`              | The PostgreSQL persistence backend (transactional quotas, multi-process safe)       |
| `defaultBackend`               | Opens the `FileSystemBackend` the standalone server uses (async)                    |
| `onboardingTokenAuthorizer`    | Stock `authorizeProvisioning` callback that checks a shared-secret bearer token     |
| `StorageBackend` (and friends) | The backend contract plus the rest of the domain types                              |
| `ProblemError` subclasses      | The typed protocol errors (`ResourceNotFoundError`, `PreconditionFailedError`, ...) |

The test support helpers (`startTestServer`, `openTempBackend`,
`provisionWebvhIdentity`, the `RequestFaults` seam) are exported from
`was-teaching-server/testing`, not from the root. See
[Testing against the server](#testing-against-the-server).

Importing anything from the package also loads its Fastify module augmentation,
so `FastifyInstance.serverUrl` / `.storage` and `FastifyRequest.zcap` are typed
on the decorated instance for free.

## A minimal server

```ts
import path from 'node:path'
import Fastify from 'fastify'
import { fastifyWas, FileSystemBackend } from 'was-teaching-server'

const serverUrl = process.env.SERVER_URL ?? 'http://localhost:3002'

const fastify = Fastify({ logger: true })

fastify.register(fastifyWas, {
  serverUrl,
  backend: await FileSystemBackend.open({
    dataDir: path.join(import.meta.dirname, 'data')
  })
})

// The plugin leaves the server root to the composition (the teaching server
// serves its welcome page there); the conformance suite expects a 200 at `/`.
fastify.get('/', async () => {
  return { name: 'minimal-was-server' }
})

// The port must be the one in `serverUrl` -- see the warning below.
await fastify.listen({ port: 3002, host: '0.0.0.0' })
```

That is a complete WAS + WebKMS server: `POST /spaces/`, the Space / Collection
/ Resource routes, access-control policies, quotas, export/import, and the
`/kms` keystore facet all work, and the full conformance suite passes against it
(verified against exactly this composition).

Two things to get right:

- **`serverUrl` must exactly match the URL clients reach the server at.** ZCap
  capability `invocationTarget` URLs include the full host and port, and
  verification compares them as exact strings -- `localhost` vs `127.0.0.1`, or
  a mismatched port, makes every delegated invocation fail (as a masked `404`).
  This is a property of URL-based capabilities, not a bug.
- **Say where the data lives.** When no `backend` is given, the plugin falls
  back to `defaultBackend()`, which roots its `data/` directory relative to the
  _installed package_ (i.e. inside `node_modules`) -- fine for the standalone
  checkout, almost never what a consumer wants. Pass a `dataDir` to move that
  root (the standalone server reads `WAS_DATA_DIR` into it; a library consumer
  reads its own env), or open a `FileSystemBackend` with an explicit `dataDir`
  through `await FileSystemBackend.open({ dataDir })` (plus `capacityBytes` /
  `maxUploadBytes` caps; the constructor is protected), or supply your own
  `StorageBackend` implementation. An injected `backend` carries its own root,
  so `dataDir` is ignored alongside one.

## Plugin options (`FastifyWasOptions`)

| Option                    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `serverUrl`               | Required. Base URL used to build and match zcap `invocationTarget`s (exact-match, see above). Validated at registration: a missing value is refused, and it must be an absolute `http:`/`https:` URL with no userinfo, path, query, or fragment (sub-path deployment is not supported)                                                                                                                                          |
| `backend`                 | An open `StorageBackend`, or a function `({ logger }) => Promise<StorageBackend>` the plugin calls at registration, after validating its other options, with `fastify.log` and closes with the app; defaults to `defaultBackend()` (see the caveat above). A backend with no origin id (one not obtained from `open()`) is refused                                                                                              |
| `ownsBackend`             | Whether the plugin manages the backend's lifecycle (default `true`): it sets the backend's `logger` to `fastify.log` and calls `close()` on Fastify's `onClose`. `false` does neither, for a composition that runs them itself, and requires an injected, already open `backend` (the function form is refused). A backend is obtained from its async `open()` factory, which runs the migrations, so neither setting opens one |
| `cors`                    | The `@fastify/cors` registration. `false` registers none, so the composition can bring its own. An object overrides `origin` and/or `methods`. Default: `origin: '*'`, the methods the WAS routes serve, and the exposed headers browser clients need                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `dataDir`                 | Filesystem root the default backend stores under; applied only to the default backend (an injected `backend` carries its own root). `undefined` uses the project `data/` directory                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `storageLimitPerSpace`    | Per-Space byte quota, applied only to the default backend (an injected backend carries its own `capacityBytes`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `maxUploadBytes`          | Per-upload byte cap, likewise only for the default backend; also bounds the multipart buffer.

## What the plugin does (and does not) register

`fastifyWas` is wrapped with `fastify-plugin`, so what it installs lands on the
**root** Fastify instance:

- decorations: `serverUrl`, `storage` (the active backend, with its logger wired
  to `fastify.log` unless `ownsBackend: false`), `backendProviders`,
  `enabledBackendProviders`;
- `@fastify/cors`, unless `cors: false` (by default `origin: '*'` and every
  method a WAS route serves -- WAS auth is signature-based, not cookie-based, so
  wide-open CORS is the protocol-appropriate setting; do not register
  `@fastify/cors` again yourself unless you pass `cors: false`);
- `@fastify/multipart` (its `fileSize` limit follows the backend's
  `maxUploadBytes`);
- content-type parsers: `application/*+json` parsed as JSON, and a catch-all
  pass-through so arbitrary binary media types stream to storage;
- the route groups themselves, each in its own encapsulated context, so their
  auth/digest hooks and error handler do not apply to routes you add outside the
  plugin.

It deliberately does **not** register the teaching server's extras: the
static-assets route, the Handlebars welcome page, the `/health` probe, and the
`/api/cors` proxy are added by `createApp()`, not by the plugin. A downstream
composition brings its own equivalents (or uses `createApp` -- see next
section).

## The full teaching-server composition

If you want the standalone server's exact behavior (welcome page, `/health`,
CORS proxy included) inside your own process, use `createApp` -- it takes the
same options and passes them through to the plugin:

```ts
import { createApp } from 'was-teaching-server'

const serverUrl = process.env.SERVER_URL
if (serverUrl === undefined) {
  throw new Error('SERVER_URL is required.')
}
const fastify = createApp({ serverUrl })
await fastify.listen({ port: 3002, host: '0.0.0.0' })
```

## Composing a hardened server

The intended production pattern is: register your policy and ops plugins first,
then `fastifyWas` with your persistence choice injected. Nothing protocol-shaped
lives downstream; anything that changes wire behavior belongs upstream in this
package.

```ts
import Fastify from 'fastify'
import helmet from '@fastify/helmet'
import rateLimit from '@fastify/rate-limit'
import { fastifyWas, PostgresBackend } from 'was-teaching-server'

const serverUrl = process.env.SERVER_URL
if (serverUrl === undefined) {
  throw new Error('SERVER_URL is required.')
}

const fastify = Fastify({ logger: true })

// The composition owns its backend: `open()` ran the migrations, and the
// composition drains the pool itself, so the plugin is told not to.
const backend = await PostgresBackend.open({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL
})
fastify.addHook('onClose', async () => {
  await backend.close()
})

fastify.register(helmet)
fastify.register(rateLimit, { max: 100, timeWindow: '1 minute' })
// ... metrics, an onboarding/registration gate, an admin route group ...

fastify.register(fastifyWas, {
  serverUrl,
  backend,
  ownsBackend: false
})

fastify.get('/health', async (request, reply) => {
  return reply.send({ status: 'pass' })
})

await fastify.listen({ port: 3002, host: '0.0.0.0' })
```

Two plugin defaults reach the composition's own routes, because `fastifyWas`
registers them on the root instance:

- `@fastify/cors` with `origin: '*'`. Every route the composition adds answers
  any origin too. To set its own CORS policy, a hardened composition passes
  `cors: false` and registers `@fastify/cors` itself, or passes a `cors` object
  with its own `origin`.
- The `'*'` catch-all content-type parser, which hands any body with an
  unmatched media type to the handler as a raw stream instead of answering 415.
  A composition route that expects only JSON checks the content type itself, or
  sits in an encapsulated context that calls `removeAllContentTypeParsers()` and
  adds back the parsers it accepts.

To let the plugin own the backend and log its startup work, pass the function
form instead:

```ts
fastify.register(fastifyWas, {
  serverUrl,
  backend: ({ logger }) =>
    PostgresBackend.open({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL, logger })
})
```

With `ownsBackend: false` the plugin does not set the backend's `logger`, so the
composition wires its own if it wants backend diagnostics in its log.

## Implementing a custom backend

The package ships two `StorageBackend` implementations: the reference
`FileSystemBackend` (JSON + blobs on disk) and `PostgresBackend` (rows in
PostgreSQL, with transactional quota accounting and row-lock conditional writes,
so multiple server processes can share one database). Both speak the same tar
export/import dialect, so archives migrate between them in either direction.

A custom persistence layer implements the same `StorageBackend` interface (the
package's second contract, alongside the wire protocol). The contract and its
invariants are documented on the interface itself; the load-bearing ones:

- getters resolve falsy for not-found (they do not throw);
- writes are upserts; deletes are idempotent;
- throw the package's typed errors (`PreconditionFailedError`,
  `PayloadTooLargeError`, ...) so the request layer's error handler maps them to
  the spec's problem-details responses;
- expose a `logger` property typed as Fastify's `FastifyBaseLogger`, defaulting
  to a silent logger -- the plugin overwrites it with `fastify.log` at
  registration (unless `ownsBackend: false`), so backend diagnostics flow to the
  server log.

```ts
import type { StorageBackend } from 'was-teaching-server'

export class S3Backend implements StorageBackend {
  // ...
}
```

## Testing against the server

A consumer's own tests can boot the real server in-process through the
`was-teaching-server/testing` entry point. It carries the boot this package's
own suites use. It imports no test runner, so it works under Vitest,
`node:test`, or any other runner. It adds nothing to the plugin's options. It is
test support, not part of a production composition.

`startTestServer()` takes the `createApp()` options except `serverUrl`, plus an
optional `port` and `logger`. The logger defaults to `false`. The server listens
on an OS-assigned port, so parallel test workers do not collide. The returned
`serverUrl` is `http://localhost:<port>`. The host is `localhost` because
`@interop/webkms-client` relaxes its loopback checks for that host alone.

ZCap `invocationTarget` URLs embed host and port. The port is not known until
the server listens, so build every client from the returned `serverUrl`, after
the boot.

When the boot fails, for example on a port already in use, `startTestServer()`
closes the Fastify instance before it rethrows. A backend the plugin owns is
closed with it. `openTempBackend()` likewise removes its temp dir when the
backend fails to open.

```ts
import assert from 'node:assert'
import { randomUUID } from 'node:crypto'
import { afterAll, beforeAll, it } from 'vitest'
import type { FastifyInstance } from 'fastify'
import { Ed25519VerificationKey } from '@interop/ed25519-verification-key'
import { WasClient } from '@interop/was-client'
import { openTempBackend, startTestServer } from 'was-teaching-server/testing'

let fastify: FastifyInstance
let serverUrl: string
let did: string
let was: WasClient

beforeAll(async () => {
  const started = await startTestServer({ backend: await openTempBackend() })
  fastify = started.fastify
  serverUrl = started.serverUrl

  // Clients come after the boot, from the serverUrl it returned.
  const keyPair = await Ed25519VerificationKey.generate()
  did = `did:key:${keyPair.fingerprint()}`
  was = WasClient.fromSigner({ serverUrl, signer: keyPair.didKeySigner() })
})

afterAll(async () => {
  await fastify.close()
})

it('creates a Space', async () => {
  const space = was.space(randomUUID())
  await space.configure({ name: 'Test Space', controller: did })
  const metadata = await space.describe()
  assert.equal(metadata?.controller, did)
})
```

The examples here use `@interop/was-client` and
`@interop/ed25519-verification-key`, which a consumer adds as its own dev
dependencies.

The plugin owns an injected backend by default (`ownsBackend: true`), so
`fastify.close()` calls the backend's `close()` and removes the temp dir. Call
`backend.close()` yourself when the server was started with
`ownsBackend: false`, when the backend never reached a server, or when a refused
plugin option failed the registration. A repeat call is a no-op.

A test that stops a server and boots a replacement over the same data needs a
dir that outlives the first server. It opens a plain `FileSystemBackend` over
its own dir through the async `open()` factory, and pins the replacement to the
first server's `port`. Ids the first server minted embed its `serverUrl`, so
they resolve only on the same port. The test removes its dir when it is done.

```ts
import { mkdtemp, rm } from 'node:fs/promises'
import { tmpdir } from 'node:os'
import path from 'node:path'
import { FileSystemBackend } from 'was-teaching-server'
import { startTestServer } from 'was-teaching-server/testing'

const dataDir = await mkdtemp(path.join(tmpdir(), 'my-suite-'))

const first = await startTestServer({
  backend: await FileSystemBackend.open({ dataDir })
})
// ... write through clients built from first.serverUrl ...
await first.fastify.close()

const second = await startTestServer({
  backend: await FileSystemBackend.open({ dataDir }),
  port: first.port
})
// ... read back what the first server wrote ...
await second.fastify.close()
await rm(dataDir, { recursive: true, force: true })
```

`provisionWebvhIdentity()` sets up a self-hosted `did:webvh` by hand. It creates
a Space under a `did:key` owner, mints the DID in one of that Space's
Collections (`id` by default), and publishes its `did.jsonl` log there. It fits
a test about a server rule in which the identity is setup, not the thing under
test. The `owner` is a `{ did, was }` pair, where `was` is a `WasClient` signed
by that `did:key`. The parameter is typed by the members the function calls,
since this package does not depend on `@interop/was-client`. When a step fails
after the Space was created, the Space is deleted before the error is rethrown.

```ts
import { provisionWebvhIdentity } from 'was-teaching-server/testing'

const ownerKey = await Ed25519VerificationKey.generate()
const owner = {
  did: `did:key:${ownerKey.fingerprint()}`,
  was: WasClient.fromSigner({ serverUrl, signer: ownerKey.didKeySigner() })
}
const account = await provisionWebvhIdentity({
  owner,
  serverUrl,
  withLadderKey: true
})
// account.did resolves on this server. account.clientKeyPair and
// account.ladderKeyPair are listed in its document.
```

The document always lists one enrolled-client key under all four signing
relations. `withLadderKey` adds a key under `assertionMethod` and
`capabilityDelegation` alone, the ladder verification method shape.
`withTransientKey` adds one under `capabilityInvocation` and
`capabilityDelegation` alone, the transient annex verification method shape. The
returned `ladderKeyPair` and `transientKeyPair` are typed as present when the
matching flag is the literal `true`. `services` sets the document's service
entries. The Space stays under the `did:key` owner. Promoting it to the new DID
is left to the test, since Space creation accepts a `did:key` controller alone.

### Failing and holding a request

`startTestServer()` also returns `faults`, for a test about a run interrupted
between two requests. Its hooks run ahead of every route group's own hooks, the
`/kms` routes included, so a fault fires before authorization and before any
handler.

| Member                                    | What it does                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `faults.requests`                         | Every request so far, in arrival order: `{ method, path, did?, status?, fault? }`             |
| `faults.refuse({ match, status, times })` | Answers the matching request with `status` (default 503) before any handler runs              |
| `faults.dropResponse({ match, times })`   | Lets the matching request be applied, then closes the connection in place of the response     |
| `faults.hold({ match })`                  | Pauses the matching request before any handler runs; returns `{ held, release }`              |
| `faults.reset()`                          | Disarms every fault not yet taken, releases every held request, and empties `faults.requests` |

The two tears leave different states. A refused request leaves the store
untouched. A dropped response leaves the write stored while the client sees a
transport failure. The second is the state a re-run has to detect from what is
stored.

`match` is an object naming any of `method`, `path`, and `did`, or a function
over the request's record. `path` is compared with the query string removed, as
an exact string or a `RegExp`. A string is compared with percent-encoding
decoded on both sides, so `my doc` matches a request for `my%20doc`. Its
trailing slash counts: a container URL and its no-slash form are different
requests. `did` is the DID of the `Authorization` header's `keyId`. It is read
before any signature is verified, so it names who the request claims to be
signed by. An object with no `method` never matches an `OPTIONS` request, so a
browser's CORS preflight does not take a fault meant for the request behind it.

A fault fires on the first matching request and is then disarmed. `refuse()` and
`dropResponse()` return `{ fired }`, a promise that resolves with the request's
record when the fault is first taken. `times` is a positive integer or
`Infinity`, and anything else throws a `RangeError`.

A fault disarmed before any request took it rejects its `fired` or `held`
promise with a `RequestFaultDisarmedError`. That happens on `reset()`, when the
server closes, and when a hold's `release()` is called before its request
arrives. A test awaiting a request that never came then fails with that error
instead of timing out.

A refusal is sent ahead of the CORS plugin, so it sets
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` itself on a request that carries an `Origin`
header. A browser-driven test then reads the refusal's status instead of a CORS
failure. A record's `status` is read when the response head is written, after
every `onSend` hook.

`@interop/was-client` retries a request that fails with a 5xx or a dropped
connection. A fault that fires once is then absorbed by the retry, and the
caller sees a success. Pass `times` (`Infinity` is allowed) to fail the retries
too, or refuse with a 4xx status, which is not retried. Under `dropResponse()`
each retried write is applied again.

`dropResponse()` is meant for writes. A response the server streams may have
nothing left to lose by the time the connection closes.

```ts
const { fastify, serverUrl, faults } = await startTestServer({
  backend: await openTempBackend()
})
// ... build clients, provision a Space and a `notes` Collection ...
const notes = was.space(spaceId).collection('notes')
const path = `/space/${spaceId}/notes/second`

// A ceremony that writes two Resources, torn at the second write. The write
// lands, and the client is told it failed.
faults.dropResponse({ match: { method: 'PUT', path }, times: Infinity })
await notes.put('first', { step: 1 })
await assert.rejects(notes.put('second', { step: 2 }))

faults.reset()
assert.deepEqual(await notes.get('second'), { step: 2 })
```

A hold interleaves two clients at a chosen request. `held` resolves once the
request has arrived and is paused. Closing the server releases every held
request, so a test that fails before `release()` does not hang `close()`.

```ts
const { held, release } = faults.hold({ match: { method: 'PUT', path } })
const first = notes.put('second', { writer: 'first' })
await held
await notes.put('second', { writer: 'second' })
release()
await first
// The held write was applied last.
```

## Verifying your composition

The `was-conformance` CLI (from
[`@interop/was-conformance-suite`](https://github.com/interop-alliance/was-conformance-suite))
runs against any WAS server by URL and is the definition of "speaks WAS." Point
it at your composed server:

```bash
npx was-conformance http://localhost:3002
```

The URL must be exactly the `serverUrl` the server was started with (the same
exact-match rule as above). If your server gates `POST /spaces/` behind an
onboarding token, pass `--token`.
