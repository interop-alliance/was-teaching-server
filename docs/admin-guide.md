# Administrator's Guide

Operational guidance for deploying and running `was-teaching-server`. The
README's "Environment variables" table is the reference for every config knob;
this document covers the procedures that span more than one variable or more
than one restart.

## At-rest KMS key-record encryption

**Scope.** This layer encrypts the server's own WebKMS **key records** -- the
private key material behind `/kms`. It has nothing to do with encrypted
Collections, where encryption is client-side and the server stores opaque
ciphertext it cannot decrypt. The two layers share the words "KEK" and
"rotation" and nothing else.

**Threat model.** The KEK(s) live in process env and process memory. At-rest
encryption therefore defends against a **disk or database dump** (backups,
storage volumes, decommissioned drives) -- not against a compromised server
process, which holds both the KEKs and every decrypted record that passes
through it. Treat the KEK values with the same secret-manager hygiene as
`DATABASE_URL`. Moving the KEK out of the process (HSM / cloud KMS behind the
`recordKekLoader()` seam) is future work.

### Configuration surface

Three env variables, parsed together at startup (`parseKmsRecordKekRegistry` in
`src/config.default.ts`):

| variable                 | role                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `KMS_RECORD_KEK`         | A single AES-256 KEK in base58btc Multikey form. The single-KEK alias; mutually exclusive with `KMS_RECORD_KEKS`.                                                           |
| `KMS_RECORD_KEKS`        | A comma-separated list of KEKs (same encoding). Every entry is registered for decryption; the **first entry** wraps new records by default.                                 |
| `KMS_RECORD_CURRENT_KEK` | Optional override of which registered KEK wraps new records: a `urn:kek:sha256:<hex>` id, a multibase KEK value, or the literal `none` (decrypt-only; see wind-down below). |

All three unset means key records are stored **plaintext** (the teaching
default). Every KEK is identified by an id derived from its raw key bytes
(`urn:kek:sha256:<hex>` -- `deriveKekId()`), and each encrypted record stores
the id of the KEK it was wrapped under, which is what makes rotation a config
change rather than a data migration.

**Misconfiguration fails the deploy, not the request path.** Setting both
`KMS_RECORD_KEK` and `KMS_RECORD_KEKS`, a duplicate list entry, a
`KMS_RECORD_CURRENT_KEK` that matches no registered KEK, a dangling
`KMS_RECORD_CURRENT_KEK` with no KEKs configured, or a malformed key value all
crash the process at startup, with the offending variable (and, for a list
entry, its 1-based position) named -- the secret value is never echoed. A
rollout should treat any change to these variables as "restart required, watch
the health check".

### Enabling encryption on an existing deployment

Set `KMS_RECORD_KEK` (or a one-entry `KMS_RECORD_KEKS`) and restart. From that
point, newly generated key records are envelope-encrypted before they reach
storage. (To mint the KEK value itself, see step 1 of the rotation runbook below
-- the same generation recipe applies.)

**Existing plaintext records are never rewritten by the server.** They stay
plaintext and readable forever (the deliberate pass-through upgrade path).
Enabling encryption on a deployment that already has keystores protects _future_
key material only; to re-wrap what is already on disk, stop the server and run
the offline re-encryption tool (see below).

### KEK rotation runbook

Goal: new key records wrap under a fresh KEK, while every record written under
the previous KEK keeps decrypting.

1. **Generate the new KEK**: 32 random bytes, encoded as a base58btc Multikey
   (`z...`) with the AES-256 header (`0xa2 0x01`) -- the same form the current
   KEK is in. The convenient way is `@interop/did-cli`:

   ```bash
   di key create --type aes256
   ```

   which prints the `secretKeyMultibase` value for the env var alongside its
   derived `urn:kek:sha256:` id (the form `KMS_RECORD_CURRENT_KEK` accepts).
   Without the CLI, the same recipe as a one-liner (run from this repo so
   `@digitalcredentials/bnid` resolves):

   ```bash
   node --input-type=module -e "
   import { randomBytes } from 'node:crypto'
   import { IdEncoder } from '@digitalcredentials/bnid'
   const bytes = Buffer.concat([Buffer.from([0xa2, 0x01]), randomBytes(32)])
   console.log(new IdEncoder({ encoding: 'base58', multibase: true }).encode(bytes))
   "
   ```

   Store the value in your secret manager.

2. **Prepend it to the list.** Change config to:

   ```
   KMS_RECORD_KEKS=<newKek>,<oldKek>
   ```

   (If the deployment currently uses the `KMS_RECORD_KEK` single-var alias, move
   that value into the list as the second entry and unset the alias -- setting
   both is a startup error.)

3. **Restart every instance.** If several server processes share one storage
   backend, roll the change to **all** of them: an instance still holding only
   the old config cannot decrypt records written by an instance already wrapping
   under the new KEK, and will 500 on reads of those keys.
4. **Verify**: the server starts (a config mistake fails startup), existing
   keystores still perform key operations (old records unwrap under the old
   KEK), and a newly generated key's stored record carries the new KEK's
   `kekId`.

Two rules to encode in your config management:

- **Never remove a KEK from the list while any record on disk was written under
  it.** Removal makes those records undecryptable (500 on use). To retire a KEK,
  first re-wrap every record under the current one with the offline
  re-encryption tool (see below); only a clean run (`0 failed`, and a
  `--dry-run` re-check reporting every record already current) makes dropping
  the old KEK from the list safe.
- **Order is meaningful.** The first entry is the write key. A config system
  that alphabetizes or otherwise reorders lists will silently change which KEK
  wraps new records. To make the choice explicit and order-proof, set
  `KMS_RECORD_CURRENT_KEK` to the intended KEK (by `urn:kek:sha256:` id, or by
  value) instead of relying on position.

### Decrypt-only wind-down

You cannot simply unset the KEK variables on a deployment that has encrypted
records -- they would stop decrypting. The graceful exit is:

```
KMS_RECORD_KEKS=<kek1>,<kek2>,...
KMS_RECORD_CURRENT_KEK=none
```

Every listed KEK stays registered for decryption, but new key records are
written plaintext. This is the posture for draining out of the feature. To
finish the exit, stop the server and run the re-encryption tool under this same
config (see below): with `KMS_RECORD_CURRENT_KEK=none` it decrypts every
encrypted record back to plaintext, after which no encrypted record remains and
the KEK variables can be dropped entirely.

### Offline re-encryption (`pnpm reencrypt-kms-records`)

`scripts/reencrypt-kms-records.ts` is the one-shot tool that rewrites the key
records already on disk to the currently configured at-rest form. It walks every
record under `<dataDir>/keystores/*/keys/`, decrypts each through the configured
KEK registry (plaintext records pass through), re-encrypts it under the current
KEK -- or leaves it plaintext when `KMS_RECORD_CURRENT_KEK=none` -- and writes
it back in place (an atomic, durable write-temp-and-rename from the same helper
module the server's own writes go through). Records already in the target form
are left untouched, so the tool is idempotent and safe to re-run.

Use it in three situations:

1. **After enabling encryption** on a deployment that already has keystores:
   re-wraps the pre-existing plaintext records, which the server itself never
   rewrites.
2. **To retire a KEK after a rotation**: re-wraps records still under the old
   KEK so it can finally be removed from `KMS_RECORD_KEKS`.
3. **To finish the decrypt-only wind-down**: with `KMS_RECORD_CURRENT_KEK=none`,
   decrypts every record back to plaintext so the KEK variables can be dropped.

Two hard constraints:

- **Stop the server first.** Key records are create-only through the backend;
  the tool rewrites them in place and does not coordinate with a live process. A
  server running concurrently can race the rewrite or serve a key mid-swap.
- **Filesystem backend only.** The tool walks the on-disk keystore tree; it
  refuses to run (exit 2) when `DATABASE_URL` is set, because re-encryption for
  the Postgres backend is not implemented.

Run it with the **same KEK env variables the server runs with** -- it parses
them with the same startup code, so tool and server can never disagree about
which KEK is current. A typical retire-a-KEK sequence:

```bash
# 1. Stop the server.

# 2. Preview: what would be rewritten?
KMS_RECORD_KEKS=<newKek>,<oldKek> pnpm reencrypt-kms-records --dry-run

# 3. Rewrite for real (the tool reads WAS_DATA_DIR; pass --data-dir <path>
#    if the data tree is somewhere else).
KMS_RECORD_KEKS=<newKek>,<oldKek> pnpm reencrypt-kms-records

# 4. Verify: a second dry run must report every record "already under the
#    current KEK" and 0 failed.
KMS_RECORD_KEKS=<newKek>,<oldKek> pnpm reencrypt-kms-records --dry-run

# 5. Now (and only now) drop the old KEK and restart the server.
KMS_RECORD_KEK=<newKek>
```

The summary line reports, per record, whether it was newly encrypted,
re-wrapped, decrypted to plaintext, or already in the target form. A `FAILED`
record (usually one wrapped under a KEK missing from the registry -- add it back
to `KMS_RECORD_KEKS` and re-run) is left untouched and makes the tool exit 1;
never remove a KEK from the config while any run still reports failures or
rewrites.

Back up the data directory before the first real run. The rewrite is atomic per
record file, but a re-wrap replaces ciphertext the old KEK could decrypt with
ciphertext only the new KEK can -- a config mistake discovered late is much
easier to recover from with a backup.

## Server identity

**Scope.** The server has an identity of its own, separate from every Space
controller: a `did:webvh` DID whose document lists the key the server will sign
export archives with. Both are published on `GET /service` under `instance`
(`exportSigningKey`, `serverDid`). Once the identity is provisioned, every Space
export carries signed provenance (see Signed exports below). Until then exports
are unsigned. The same key signs the server's invocations when it replicates a
Space from a peer, once the log allows it (see Enabling replication below).

**Three secrets, two holders.** The server holds one secret, the seed its
signing key is derived from (`WAS_SERVER_KEY_SEED`). The administrator holds the
other two. The first is the admin's own `did:key`, named in `WAS_ADMIN_DID`. It
controls the `server` Space and signs the `PUT` that stores the log there. The
second is the update key of the DID's history log. It is not the admin
`did:key`. It is a key that the `di` command-line tool (`@interop/did-cli`)
creates and keeps in the admin's local wallet, with pre-rotation armed, which is
the CLI default. Pre-rotation means the log already commits to the hash of a
staged next key, so one leaked update key is not fatal (see Compromise
recovery).

The server never mints or extends its own log, and it holds no update key. The
CLI is the only writer, and the admin's wallet copy is the source of truth. A
compromised server can forge signatures until the seed is rotated, but it cannot
take the DID over. A data wipe cannot lose the update key, because the server
never had it. The admin, in turn, never holds or sees the seed. The server key
enters the log only as its public `exportSigningKey`, read off `/service`.

**Where the log lives.** The DID is `did:webvh:{scid}:{host}:space:server:id`,
and its log is the `did.jsonl` Resource of the `id` Collection in the `server`
Space. The server provisions that Space at startup, controlled by
`WAS_ADMIN_DID` and typed `AuxiliarySpace` + `ServerInstanceSpace`. List Spaces
lists it for the admin with that `type`. The admin writes the log there like any
other client write, signed by the admin key.

**The admin's wallet.** The CLI keeps its state under `$WALLET_DIR` (default
`~/.config/did-cli-wallet`), with DIDs under `dids/<method>/`. For the server's
`did:webvh` it holds these files:

- `<did>.json` -- the DID document.
- `<did>.jsonl` -- the history log, the bytes the admin `PUT`s to the server.
- `<did>.update-keys.json` -- the secrets of the active and the staged update
  key.
- `<did>.meta.json` -- the local metadata, such as the handle.

`di did meta server-id --json` prints the file locations. Back up the whole
wallet directory after every append. Losing the update-keys file freezes the
log: no further entry can be signed. The DID still resolves, but it cannot
change, so the next rotation needs a fresh identity.

### Configuration surface

| variable              | role                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WAS_SERVER_KEY_SEED` | 32-byte Ed25519 seed in bnid's secret-key-seed encoding (`z1A...`). Unset: no signing key, `/service` carries no `exportSigningKey`, and exports carry no provenance.                        |
| `WAS_ADMIN_DID`       | The admin's Ed25519 `did:key`, controller of the `server` Space. It is not the log's update key. Unset: the `server` Space is not provisioned, and no client can be told apart as the admin. |

Both are read at startup. A malformed seed, a seed of the wrong length, or a
`WAS_ADMIN_DID` that is not an Ed25519 `did:key` fails the deploy. So does a
stored `server` Space that is not typed `ServerInstanceSpace` (one written
before the id was reserved; delete it or unset the variable) or whose controller
is not `WAS_ADMIN_DID` (the admin DID changed; update the Space's controller
through Update Space, or restore the variable).

### Provisioning the identity

The runbooks below use `{SERVER_URL}` for the server's public URL, and the
wallet handles `admin` (the admin `did:key`), `server` (the `server` Space) and
`server-id` (the server's `did:webvh`).

1. Generate the seed with `@interop/bnid`'s `generateSecretKeySeed()` (the
   encoding the test fixtures' seeds use). From this repo:

   ```bash
   node -e "import('@interop/bnid').then(async m=>console.log(await m.generateSecretKeySeed()))"
   ```

   Set it as `WAS_SERVER_KEY_SEED`, with the same secret hygiene as the KEK.
   Every machine of a deployment gets the same seed, so they share one key.

2. Create the admin key in the wallet. Its printed `id` is the `did:key`:

   ```bash
   di did create key --save --handle admin
   ```

   To import an existing admin key instead, pass its seed:
   `SECRET_KEY_SEED=<seed> di did create key --save --handle admin`. Unset
   `SECRET_KEY_SEED` again before step 6. There it would seed the log's update
   key.

3. Set `WAS_ADMIN_DID` to that `did:key` and restart. The log line
   `No server DID lists the export-signing key yet` is expected at this point.

4. Register the `server` Space, create the `id` Collection, and publish it:

   ```bash
   di was space add {SERVER_URL}/space/server --handle server --did admin
   di was collection create server --id id --name "Server identity"
   di was publish server/id
   ```

   The Collection is world-readable on purpose. A `did:webvh` log is what
   outside resolvers read. The CLI also fetches it unauthenticated for its
   fast-forward check before every append. That check treats a 404 as "never
   published", so on an unpublished log it would pass without checking anything.

5. Read the server key off `/service`. The multibase is the part after
   `did:key:`:

   ```bash
   curl -s {SERVER_URL}/service | jq -r .instance.exportSigningKey
   ```

6. Mint the DID around that key:

   ```bash
   di did create webvh --url {SERVER_URL}/space/server/id \
     --verification-key <exportSigningKey multibase> --purpose assertionMethod \
     --vm-id-fragment multibase --save --handle server-id
   ```

   `assertionMethod` is required. The one other relationship the server key may
   hold is `capabilityInvocation`, which enables replication. To enable it from
   the start, pass `--purpose assertionMethod capabilityInvocation` instead. Any
   other relationship (`capabilityDelegation`, `authentication`, `keyAgreement`)
   withdraws `serverDid`, because the server refuses to advertise a key that
   could delegate.

7. Store the log. Always pass `--content-type text/jsonl`:

   ```bash
   di was put server/id/did.jsonl "$(di did meta server-id --json | jq -r .files.log)" --content-type text/jsonl
   ```

8. Confirm, then back up the wallet directory:

   ```bash
   curl -s {SERVER_URL}/service | jq -r .instance.serverDid
   ```

   This prints the `did:webvh`.

### Signed exports

With the identity provisioned, `POST /space/:spaceId/export` adds two entries at
the root of the archive, beside `manifest.yml` and `service.json`:

- `provenance.jsonl` -- one signed statement per exported object: the Space
  Metadata object, each Collection Metadata object, and each Resource. A
  statement names the object's URL, its `createdBy`, `createdAt`, and write
  stamp (`updatedAt`, `updatedAtCounter`, `originId`), a Resource's `/meta`
  record stamp (`meta`), a digest of a Resource's content, and the `versionId`
  of the log entry the key was listed in (`didLogVersionId`).
- `did.jsonl` -- a copy of the server's history log as it stood at export time,
  so an importer verifies the statements offline, with no request to this
  server.

The statements name the key as `{serverDid}#{publicKeyMultibase}`, which is the
method id provisioning step 6 writes with `--vm-id-fragment multibase`. A log
that lists the key under another id keeps `serverDid` on `/service` but leaves
exports unsigned.

An export made while the server has no identity carries neither entry, and the
server logs one `warn` line per export, `Exporting without provenance`, with the
reason. Import Space verifies both entries and removes a `createdBy` no
statement attests.

### Rotating the seed

A new seed is a new key. A rotation appends to the log rather than minting a new
one, so the SCID and the DID stay the same.

1. Set the new `WAS_SERVER_KEY_SEED` and restart. `/service` drops `serverDid`
   from here until step 4.
2. Read the new `exportSigningKey` off `/service`, as in provisioning step 5.
3. Replace the key in the log:

   ```bash
   di did webvh replace-key server-id --verification-key <new multibase> -y
   ```

   This appends one entry. It lists the new key under the same relationships and
   drops the old method. The update key advances as part of the same entry. The
   fast-forward check runs first, so the server must be reachable.

4. Store the whole log again, as in provisioning step 7.
5. Check that `serverDid` is back on `/service`, and back up the wallet.

Archives signed under the old key keep verifying against the log epoch their
envelope names.

### Enabling replication

A server replicates a Space from a peer by invoking a capability the Space's
controller delegated to its `serverDid`. It signs that invocation with the seed
key, as the same method `{serverDid}#{publicKeyMultibase}` it signs exports
with. The peer checks the signature against this server's log, so the key must
be listed there under `capabilityInvocation`, beside `assertionMethod`. That
relationship is the switch that enables replication. Without it, or without an
advertised `serverDid`, the server has no sync signer, and a replica
registration is refused naming which of the two is missing. There is no second
key, and `/service` names none. The DID is the advertisement.

To add the relationship to an identity provisioned without it, append an entry
that lists the key under both relationships. `di` has no command that changes
the relationships of a listed key in place: `replace-key` refuses the key the
document already lists. So the entry is appended as part of a seed rotation.
Follow "Rotating the seed", and at its step 3 pass both relationships:

```bash
di did webvh replace-key server-id --verification-key <new multibase> \
  --purpose assertionMethod capabilityInvocation -y
```

Then store the log and check `serverDid` as in steps 4 and 5. A later
`replace-key` without `--purpose` keeps both relationships.

A controller delegates to `serverDid`, not to the key. Rotating the seed
therefore needs no re-delegation: existing grants verify against the new key
once the log lists it.

The registration itself is the controller's to make, at
`POST /space/<id>/replicas` on the server that pulls. That server reaches its
peer over `https` on the default port only, and only at public addresses. Two
servers that replicate need different origin ids. The state of a registration's
pull loop is served to the controller at `/space/<id>/replicas/<id>/status`.

### Rotating the update key

Rotate the update key on a schedule, or after a suspected leak:

```bash
di did webvh rotate-keys server-id -y
```

This reveals the staged key, retires the active one, and stages a fresh next
key. The document's verification methods are unchanged. `--keep-old-key` keeps
the retired secret in the update-keys file. Then store the log as in
provisioning step 7, check that `serverDid` is unchanged on `/service`, and back
up the wallet.

### Restoring the log after a data wipe

The log lives in the data dir and dies with it. The seed survives in the secret
store, so the key does not change. After the wipe the server re-provisions the
empty `server` Space at startup. The admin's local registry still knows the
`server` handle, so the admin re-creates the Collection and stores the wallet's
log unchanged:

```bash
di was collection create server --id id --name "Server identity"
di was publish server/id
di was put server/id/did.jsonl "$(di did meta server-id --json | jq -r .files.log)" --content-type text/jsonl
```

Same SCID, same DID. Check `serverDid` on `/service`. Keeping the log out of the
wipe (`spaces/server` on the filesystem backend) is a convenience, not a
requirement. If the wallet is lost too, the DID cannot be extended. The operator
provisions a fresh identity, and old archives still verify against the log
snapshot they embed.

### Compromise recovery

Each secret is recovered on its own.

#### Leaked server seed

Rotate the seed exactly as in "Rotating the seed". Then note the `versionId` of
the entry `replace-key` appended, for example `2-Qm...`:

```bash
di did show server-id --meta --json | jq -r .versionId
```

Archives whose envelope names an earlier epoch were signed by a key the attacker
may have held. Treat the ones made from the time of the leak onward as suspect.

When replication is enabled, the same key signs sync invocations, so the
attacker can also invoke every capability delegated to `serverDid`. Retiring a
stolen sync key means rotating the seed, which rotates the export key too. There
is no way to retire one role and keep the other. `replace-key` keeps the key's
relationships, so replication stays enabled under the new key. To disable it in
the same step, pass `--purpose assertionMethod`. Peers cache the server's
document, so the old key can keep verifying there for a while after the
rotation.

#### Leaked update key

Run `di did webvh rotate-keys server-id -y`, store the log, and check
`serverDid`. Pre-rotation is what makes this safe. A valid next entry must be
signed by the staged key, whose hash the log already committed to, so the
attacker's copy of the active key cannot sign one. The server verifies every
append, and refuses one that does not verify. The update-keys file holds the
staged secret too, so a leak of that whole file gives the attacker a key that
can sign. Rotate before the attacker can use it. Storing an entry also needs
write authority on the `server` Space, which is the admin key's, not the update
key's. The server accepts only a log that extends the one it serves. If the
served log still carries an entry the wallet did not write, delete the `id`
Collection as the admin (`di was collection delete server/id`), then re-create,
publish and store the wallet's log as in "Restoring the log after a data wipe",
and rotate.

#### Leaked admin `did:key`

The log is untouched, since the admin key was never its update key. Move the
`server` Space to a new admin key, in this order:

1. Create the new key: `di did create key --save --handle admin-2`.
2. Restate the Space's controller, signed by the old key. `di was space update`
   has no controller option, so this is a `PUT` of the Space Metadata object at
   `{SERVER_URL}/space/server/meta`. Its body restates the stored `type`
   (`["AuxiliarySpace", "ServerInstanceSpace", "Space"]`) with the new
   `controller`.
3. Set `WAS_ADMIN_DID` to the new `did:key` and restart. Do step 2 first: the
   server refuses to start when the stored controller and `WAS_ADMIN_DID`
   disagree.
4. Re-register the Space under the new key:

   ```bash
   di was space forget server
   di was space add {SERVER_URL}/space/server --handle server --did admin-2
   ```

5. Check `serverDid` on `/service`.

### Moving `SERVER_URL`

The DID string carries the host, so a log written for another host does not
resolve as this server's, and `/service` drops `serverDid` after the move. The
log was created portable (the CLI default), so a domain-move entry addressing
`{NEW_SERVER_URL}/space/server/id` keeps the SCID. The CLI's domain-move command
is not shipped yet. Until it is, the admin appends that entry with a library
call and `PUT`s the log under the new host. Re-minting a fresh identity instead
is also fine, at the cost of provenance continuity.

## Store origin id

**Scope.** Every store carries one origin id: a filesystem data directory, or a
Postgres schema. It is the origin half of a write's replicated identity, for
replicating a Space between servers. It is not the server DID. Most deployments
have no DID, the DID embeds the host, and it changes when the admin re-mints the
log. The origin id only has to be stable, and unique among every server a Space
may replicate to. Nothing verifies it, so it can be short and opaque.

The id is settled on every boot, under the store lock:

- A store with no id takes `WAS_ORIGIN_ID` when set. Otherwise it mints a random
  16-byte base58 id. Either way it keeps that id for the store's life.
- A store that carries an id keeps it. Unsetting `WAS_ORIGIN_ID` later changes
  nothing.
- A set `WAS_ORIGIN_ID` that differs from the stored id fails the deploy, and
  the error names both. So does a value outside the charset or over 64
  characters.

The filesystem backend stores it as the `originId` member of the data
directory's `store.json`, beside `version`. The Postgres backend stores it in
the single row of the `store` table, column `origin_id`. `GET /service`
advertises it as `originId` on the core `https://w3id.org/pws` specs entry.

### Operator rules

- Keep it unique among every server a Space may replicate to. Two servers with
  one id could mint the same stamp for two different writes.
- A cloned data directory or database carries its id with it. A restored clone
  that will run beside its source must boot with a fresh `WAS_ORIGIN_ID` over an
  empty store, then take the Space's data by import or replication.
- A data wipe mints a fresh id. That is fine, since a wiped store has no writes
  to replicate.

## Write stamps

Every versioned record a store writes carries a write stamp: `updatedAt`,
`updatedAtCounter`, and the store's `originId`. The store's hybrid logical clock
mints it. The record's `ETag` is built from it and the record's generation, as
`"<generation>.<ms>.<counter>.<originId>"`. A Space or Collection Metadata
object appends a fifth, local segment.

| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WAS_REPLICATION_CLOCK_BOUND_MS` | How far ahead of this server's physical clock, in milliseconds, a stamp received from a peer may be dated. Default 60000. A value that is not a positive integer fails the deploy. A stamp dated further ahead stalls the pull of its Collection until local time catches up. |

The clock persists a high-water mark of its physical part, at most about once a
second. The filesystem backend keeps it as `clockHighWater` in the data
directory's `store.json`, beside `version` and `originId`. The Postgres backend
keeps it in the `store` row, column `clock_high_water`. A clean shutdown writes
the mark once more. A failed write of the mark logs one `warn` line and does not
fail the request. At boot the clock starts just past that mark. A server clock
set back across a restart therefore mints no stamp more than about a second
below the last one minted before it, and a write over a stored record always
takes a stamp above the one it replaces.

### Operator rules

- Run one server process per store. Two processes over one data directory or
  database share its origin id and could mint the same stamp for two different
  writes, giving two different representations one `ETag`.
- A store that holds any Space written before write stamps fails the deploy with
  `StoreVersionError`, on every boot. There is no migration. Wipe the store, or
  restore each Space from an export archive into an empty store. An import
  re-stamps every record with this server's clock and origin id.
