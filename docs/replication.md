# Replication

How a server replicates a Space from a peer server: the sync signer, replica
registrations and the checks they pass, the pull loop, and the apply path that
stores what the loop reads. The replication facet writes replicated records only
through the backend's `apply*` methods, and no request route can supply a write
stamp. [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) holds the layer map and the
glossary (see Replica registration, Pull loop and Creating stamp there).

## The sync signer

`src/lib/syncIdentity.ts` holds the signer a server invokes a peer's
capabilities with when it replicates a Space. It is the same seed key as the
export-signing key, named as the method `{serverDid}#{publicKeyMultibase}`.

`loadSyncSigner` returns a signer only when `resolveServerDid` yields a
`serverDid` and the resolved document lists the key under
`capabilityInvocation`. `resolveServerDid` is described in
[server-identity-and-provenance.md](server-identity-and-provenance.md).
Otherwise `loadSyncSigner` returns a refusal with a reason: no advertised
`serverDid`, or the key not listed under `capabilityInvocation`. A storage fault
met while reading the log is thrown as its 5xx and is not a refusal.

A controller delegates the pull capability to `serverDid`, so a peer verifies
the invocation against the server's log. There is no second key and no
`/service` member. Listing the relationship is the switch that enables
replication. Every read a pull loop makes of a peer Space is signed with it
(`sync/peerClient.ts`).

## Registrations

`src/sync/` is the replication facet: replica registrations and their pull
loops. A registration is one source peer of a Space, a directed edge the
controller writes at `POST /space/:spaceId/replicas`
(`requests/ReplicaRequest.ts`). It carries:

- `id`
- `fromSpace`, the peer Space's URL
- `toSpace`, this Space's URL
- `capability`, the pull capability, delegated to this server's DID with
  `allowedAction` within `GET` and `HEAD`
- an optional `collections` list
- `role`, which is `source`

`GET` there lists the records as `{ url, totalItems, items }`. `GET` and
`DELETE` of `/space/:spaceId/replicas/:replicaId` read and remove one, and there
is no `PUT`. Every method is controller-only, the reads included, through the
container rule's `controller-only`.

A record is stored inside the Space (`.replica.<id>.json` beside
`.replica.<id>.state.json` in the filesystem Space dir, a row of the Postgres
`replicas` table), so Delete Space removes it. It is not replicated and not
exported. Storing or removing one advances the Space Metadata object's local
segment, since the served `replicas` member changed (see
[validators-and-stamps.md](validators-and-stamps.md)).

## Registration checks

`sync/registration.ts` holds the checks a registration passes before it is
stored. A malformed body is `invalid-request-body` (400). The rest read the
peer, and a break of one is `replica-refused` (409). The checks are:

- The local Space is not the `server` Space.
- This server has a sync signer, and the capability is delegated to its DID.
- The peer's `/service` lists the replication entry at this server's version and
  an `originId` that is not this server's (see
  [service-description.md](service-description.md)).
- The peer Space, read through the capability, has the local Space's `type` set,
  and a controller the local one matches.
- Each Collection both sides hold agrees on the immutable members.

The peer Space's id need not equal the local one.

The `/service` read also records whether the source server lists the Encrypted
Collections entry. The answer is stored as `pullsChunks` on the stored
registration. It is not a member of the wire record the controller sends and
reads back. A registration made against a server without the entry pulls no
chunks.

The controller match has two branches. The two controllers are equal, or the
peer controller is a `did:webvh` hosted in the peer Space whose current document
lists the local Space's `did:key` controller under `capabilityInvocation`. The
second branch is the common order: a wallet promotes its Space to its
`did:webvh` before the Space gains a replica, and a new local Space is created
under one of the account's enrolled client keys. The local Space cannot be
promoted first, since the DID resolves here only through the registration.

For that branch the check reads the peer's `did.jsonl` through the pull
capability, verifies it offline, as a replicated copy is, and requires the
registration to pull the log's Collection, so the copy the promotion needs
arrives with the first pull. The DID is never fetched by itself. Once the first
pull lands, Update Space moves the local Space to the DID, and the controllers
are equal from then on. Without the controller check, a holder of any readable
pull capability could register another user's Space as a source and read the
copy through root invocations. A key the document lists under
`capabilityDelegation` alone, a ladder method, does not pass.

One check reads no peer. A registration is refused when another local Space
already replicates the same peer Space with a Collection in common, since a
`did:webvh` hosted in a Collection two local Spaces replicate resolves from
neither copy (see
[Where a replicated log lives](#where-a-replicated-log-lives)). Two
registrations on one local Space may overlap. The check is not atomic with the
write, so two concurrent registrations can both pass, and the resolver then
refuses the DID.

## Guards on Delete Replica and Update Space

Delete Replica is refused with the same `replica-refused` (409) while the
registration is the only one that maps a local Space's `did:webvh` controller to
a copy of its log. Removing it would leave that Space with no resolvable
controller, and both repairs, a new registration and Update Space, are
authorized by the controller. The handler scans every stored Space for such a
controller. The caller changes that Space's controller first. To replace a
registration, the caller adds the new one on the same Space before removing the
old one. A removal that ends a two-Space mapping is allowed. A keystore
controller is not checked. Delete Space and Delete Collection are not guarded
either: a replicated copy of a log goes away with its Collection or Space, as a
self-hosted log does.

Update Space is refused with the same `replica-refused` (409, pointer
`#/controller`) when the controller change would break a mapping. A registration
that lists its Collections always pulls the one holding its Space's controller
log, so a controller change moves what the Space's own registrations pull. It
touches at most two peer Collections: the one hosting the new controller's log,
which the change may add to a selection, and the one hosting the current
controller's log, which it may remove.

- An added Collection that another local Space's registration of the same peer
  Space already pulls is refused, since the DID would then resolve from neither
  copy and the new controller could not invoke to undo the change.
- A removed Collection the Space was the one holder of is refused while some
  local Space's controller is a `did:webvh` hosted there, since that Space would
  be left with no resolvable controller, the lockout Delete Replica refuses. A
  demotion back to a `did:key` is such a change.

The caller changes that Space's controller first, or registers the log's
Collection on this Space by name, which holds it whatever the controller.
`controllerChangeConflict` in `lib/webvhLogLocation.ts` decides both cases, and
shares the second with Delete Replica. The three checks read the stored
registrations and the other Spaces' controllers afresh, past the caches, so a
controller another process wrote a moment ago counts. A Space with no
registrations is not checked. None of the checks is atomic with its write.

## Where a replicated log lives

`src/lib/webvhLogLocation.ts` decides where this server stores the history log
of a `did:webvh`. A self-hosted DID's log is the one the DID names. A DID hosted
in a Space on a replication peer, `did:webvh:<scid>:<H>:space:<S>:<C>`, has a
local copy when exactly one local Space X holds a replica registration whose
`fromSpace` is `https://H/space/S/` and which pulls Collection C. The log is
then X's `C/did.jsonl`, and X need not be S. `locateWebvhLog` makes the mapping,
and the resolver reads that log through the same verify, cache, head-record and
fast-forward path as a native one (see
[webvh-controllers.md](webvh-controllers.md)).

The mapping goes through the registration because a local Space named S could
belong to anyone on this server. A registration passes the controller check in
`sync/registration.ts`, so only the peer Space's controller, or a current
invocation key of its `did:webvh` document, can make one. When two or more local
Spaces map one DID, it has no location and does not resolve from storage. An
older copy could list a retired key, and the head record is lost on restart, so
picking either copy would let the older one win.

The registrations are read through an index of every stored registration, cached
per backend for `REPLICA_INDEX_CACHE_TTL`. Storing or removing a registration
drops it, and so does Delete Space. The head record of a replicated DID is keyed
by the DID alone, so it survives a change of the local Space that keeps the
copy. The apply path's write of a `did.jsonl` drops the cached document, so a
key retired at the origin stops authorizing after the next pull.

Such a DID may be a Space controller, a keystore controller, a delegator, and
the `createdBy` of a write. `lib/serverIdentity.ts`, `lib/syncIdentity.ts` and
import provenance stay native-only. `invokerDid` (`createdBy`) also records a
DID resolved over the network, since the authorization that ran before decided
its key. A create the provisioning policy granted verifies no signature, so it
records no `createdBy`.

## The apply path

`src/lib/replicaApply.ts` holds the rules the apply path stores a replicated
record by. A storage backend's `apply*` methods take a record a pull loop read
from a peer and store it under the peer's write stamp and generation, so the
record's `ETag` here equals the peer's. No request route reaches them. The one
other caller is the policy copy a server backend other than the control plane
keeps (`src/lib/backendMirror.ts`), which hands `applyPolicy` the stamp and
generation the control plane's own write minted, with no registration. Both
backends decide through this module. The write stamp and the clock are described
in [validators-and-stamps.md](validators-and-stamps.md).

A record is applied when its stamp sorts above the held one by
`(ms, counter, originId)`, and skipped otherwise. An equal stamp is a record
this server already holds, which is also what stops a record from travelling
round a two-way pair. Three records follow other rules:

- A history log (a Collection's governing log, or a `did.jsonl`) fast-forwards:
  the held bytes must be a prefix of the received ones, a prefix of the held
  bytes is skipped, and anything else is a fork.
- A Collection tombstone carries no generation. It removes any life of the
  Collection created before its stamp, with its members, whatever their stamps,
  so a delete wins over a later member write.
- Two lives of one Collection id are ordered by their creating stamps (see the
  Creating stamp entry in the [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) glossary). A
  received life created after the held one replaces it, members included, and
  one created before it is skipped.

An update of a held life replaces the object except for the members that are
immutable once set (`encryption`, `revisions.resolution`, `revisions.immutable`,
and `backend`, which keeps the held selection). One the received object omits is
kept, and two different set values are a fork.

Each apply method runs inside the critical section the matching request-layer
write takes, and checks there, in order:

1. The registration is still stored and was made for the Space's current
   generation, else `unregistered`.
2. The backend's clock takes the received stamps in, else `refused` with reason
   `clock-bound`.
3. The record's Collection is live, else `skipped`.

An applied record takes a local feed position, so it appears in this server's
own `changes` feed and a third server can pull it from here (see
[changes-feed.md](changes-feed.md)). A chunked Resource takes its position once
its chunk set is complete. Preconditions, the encrypted-Collection envelope
rule, the write-once rule and the unique-attribute claims are not evaluated,
since the origin server admitted the write. Quotas and the upload cap are. The
Space Metadata object replicates its `name` alone: `controller`, `type` and the
server-derived members stay per server. Revocations, backend registrations and
keystores are not replicated. Chunks replicate with their parent Resource. A
chunk-only write on the source server takes no feed position, so it replicates
with the next write of the parent.

### Chunks

A chunked Resource is applied with its chunk set. The rules are:

- The loop discovers the set when the parent's feed document applies. It reads
  the parent's chunk listing on the source server, then reads each listed chunk
  an earlier run did not stage under the `etag` the listing names, a few at once
  (`REPLICA_CHUNK_PULL_CONCURRENCY`), then reads the parent last as a closing
  check. The parent's `ETag` must still equal the one the feed document named,
  else the pull is run again next cycle. A chunk-only delete on the source
  server during the pull is not caught by that check: it converges on the next
  write of the parent, as any chunk delete does.
- The listing is untrusted input. Each `index` must be an integer in range,
  strictly ascending and unique. Each `size` must be a non-negative integer.
  Each `contentType` must be an ASCII media type of at most 128 characters. Each
  `etag` must be a string. A listing that fails stalls the Collection as
  `source-unavailable`. So does a feed document whose `etag` is not printable
  ASCII of at most 160 characters, since that `ETag` keys the staging. A chunk
  read the source server answers without an `ETag` is retried next cycle.
- The chunks are staged, and nothing live changes until the set is whole. The
  backend's `beginChunkStaging` opens the run once per chunk pull: it drops the
  registration's staging of the Resource under any other revision, makes the
  quota pre-check of the set, and reports what the run already holds, with the
  source server's `ETag` for each. On the filesystem backend it first finishes a
  swap of the Resource a fault left torn, which changes the live set before the
  pre-check answers; a Postgres swap is one transaction, so there is none to
  finish. `stageChunk` writes one chunk to staging. Then `applyResource` with
  `chunks` takes the parent and its set in one critical section. It removes the
  live indexes the source server no longer lists, moves the staged chunks into
  place, writes the parent and takes its feed position. `reclaimStaging` removes
  staging nobody owns, and `listStagedChunks` is a plain read of a run.
- The quota pre-check is the backend's. Each listed size is checked against the
  upload cap, and the set's net growth (the listed sizes, less what the run
  already staged, less the live chunks the swap frees) against the remaining
  capacity. The filesystem backend reads the remaining capacity from the same
  cached measurement its in-write check reads (and reads none under no quota). A
  set that does not fit stalls the Collection as `quota-exceeded` with nothing
  staged. A 507 or 413 during staging stays authoritative. While a run is open,
  each `stageChunk` credits the live chunks at the indexes the run has staged so
  far, so a same-size rewrite of a stream fits under a quota its live set
  already fills. A chunk directory left beside a tombstone is credited too,
  since the swap removes it. A swap refused as `container-refused` releases the
  run's staging, as a loss does.
- There is no last-writer-wins per chunk. The set resolves with its parent
  revision. The loop decides it before reading anything from the source server,
  against the held content record, a tombstone included. When the held parent
  wins or is equal, the staging is discarded and the set stays as it is.
- A chunk carries this server's own stamp and generation, minted at the swap.
  The source server's chunk `ETag` is opaque here. It is kept with what a run
  staged and nothing else: a re-run keeps a staged chunk the listing still names
  under the same `etag` and reads every other one, with no request for the kept
  ones. A live chunk's validator is this server's own, which no listing names,
  so a parent rewritten on the source server with its chunks untouched
  re-transfers them.
- An individual chunk delete does not replicate on its own. It converges on the
  next write of the parent, when the chunk pull removes the index the source
  server no longer lists.
- A Resource with no chunks costs one listing read.
- The chunk pull runs only when the registration's `pullsChunks` is true. The
  flag is read from the source server's `/service` once, when the registration
  is made, and stored with it rather than read again each cycle: the
  registration check already reads that document, a server that drops the
  profile after registration is not a case worth one more request per cycle per
  registration, and making the registration again covers it.

## Where a replicated Collection lands

A Collection's `backend.id` keeps its meaning across servers. `default` selects
this server's default through its alias, and a fixed id (`fs`, `postgres`)
selects this deployment's backend of that id, as it does for a request. The
control plane, which `WAS_CONTROL_PLANE_BACKEND` names, holds the registrations
and every container object whatever the Collection selects. The stored copy of
the Collection Metadata object carries the peer's `backend.id` verbatim, so the
object stays the same on every server, and a replicated update keeps the held
selection, as `backend-immutable` does for a request.

The pull loop writes through the control plane (the mirroring wrapper, see
`lib/backendMirror.ts`), so an applied Collection Metadata object, governing log
or policy of a Collection on another server backend reaches that backend's copy,
and an applied tombstone removes it. The Resource documents of the feed are
applied to the backend the stored `backend.id` selects, content and `/meta`
record alike. Before the first Resource of a cycle the loop brings that
backend's copy of the Collection level, since a backend holding no copy skips
every Resource of the Collection and the checkpoint would pass them by.

Registrations live on the control plane, so a Resource apply into another server
backend cannot read one. The loop checks the registration on the control plane
first, by the rule the apply uses. The registration must be stored, and made
under the Space Metadata object's current generation. One verdict covers the
Resource documents of a feed page. The apply then runs under no `replicaId`, the
way a policy copy is written. That backend still requires its copy of the Space
and a live copy of the Collection. The copy write before the first Resource is a
step of the pull, so a refusal there (the quota, a Space gone) stalls this
Collection alone. A registration removed between the check and the write is the
window a Delete Replica already has against an apply on the control plane, whose
lock it does not take.

A page read of the feed is bounded by the upload cap of the backend the Resource
is applied to, so a document the data backend would refuse as too large stalls
the Collection before its body is buffered.

A replicated `did.jsonl` lands on that backend with the rest of its Collection.
The `did:webvh` resolver reads a log from the backend its Collection selects, so
a peer-hosted DID whose log Collection names `postgres` resolves here once its
log is applied there.

## The pull loop

`sync/replication.ts` is the `ReplicationManager`, one per app, decorated as
`replication`. It runs one pull loop per stored registration, started at
`onReady` and on registration. A cycle reads the peer Space's Metadata object
and policy (conditional reads), then its Collection listing under
`?include=deleted`.

The registration's `collections` list selects among the listed Collections, live
and tombstoned, and the Collection that holds the controller's history log is
always selected. That Collection is pulled first in every cycle, so a retired
key stops authorizing here even while a long chunk pull is waiting. The rule is
`peerCollectionSelector` in `sync/collectionSelection.ts`, which the pull loop
shares with `lib/webvhLogLocation.ts`, so the two cannot drift. A selected
tombstone is applied. One for a Collection the registration does not pull is
ignored, so it cannot remove a local Collection that shares its id.

For each selected live Collection the loop applies the Collection Metadata
object when this server does not hold that life of the Collection, then reads
its `changes` feed from the stored checkpoint and applies each document by
`kind`. A Resource's content is read by `GET`, or taken from the document's
inline `data`, and its `/meta` object is read for the members the content write
set. An `ETag` that no longer equals the one the feed named means the record
moved, and the Collection is read again next cycle. The checkpoint advances past
a document once it is applied or skipped.

A chunk pull checks the stop signal between chunks, so a shutdown does not wait
for a whole stream. The registration is checked once per chunk set, before the
run is opened; on the control plane each staging and the swap check it again
under the lock, and on another server backend the swap meets a Space gone. The
loop persists its state inside a Collection's pull once the chunk pulls since
the last persist moved `REPLICA_STATE_PERSIST_BYTES` or ran for
`REPLICA_STATE_PERSIST_DOCUMENTS` Resources, and at the end of each Collection,
so a long pull that is cut by a restart loses at most that much of its
checkpoint, without a write of the state after every small chunked Resource.

Staging is keyed by the registration and the parent revision's `ETag`. A pull
that is run again within one process life moves only the chunks that are
missing. Opening a run reclaims the registration's staging of the Resource under
any other revision before the quota check, since those bytes still count toward
usage. All staging is reclaimed at boot, and a swap that was cut short is
finished first. The next chunk pull stages again what the restart removed.
Delete Replica, Delete Resource, Delete Collection and Delete Space reclaim the
staging in their scope. Delete Replica does so even when the registration is
already gone. See [filesystem-layout.md](filesystem-layout.md) for the staging
layout.

A feed page too large to buffer is asked for again at half the size, down to one
document, which is read up to the upload cap. A binary Resource's read times out
on the wait for the response and for each chunk, so a long transfer is not cut
off.

## Stalls and backoff

A `refused` apply stalls that Collection alone. The checkpoint holds and the
reason (`clock-bound`, `fork`, `quota-exceeded`, `unsupported-backend`,
`container-refused`, `chunk-listing-obsolete`, `source-unavailable`) is stored
with the loop state, which `GET .../replicas/:replicaId/status` serves beside
the loop `state` and the pull times. The Collection is retried each cycle while
the others go on, and a clock-bound stall clears itself as local time catches
up. A Collection whose `backend.id` selects no server backend of this deployment
stalls as `unsupported-backend`, before its Metadata object is stored: a fixed
id this deployment does not configure, or a backend registered on the peer. The
stall detail reads: The Collection selects backend "<id>", which is not a server
backend this deployment configures. The stall clears once the deployment
configures that backend. See
[Where a replicated Collection lands](#where-a-replicated-collection-lands).

Two reasons come from the chunk pull. `chunk-listing-obsolete` means the source
server rewrites the Resource faster than the pull completes, so the closing
check fails cycle after cycle. `source-unavailable` means a request to the
source server keeps failing inside a chunk pull, or its chunk listing is
malformed. The detail names the URL. Both follow a bounded retry. A pull that
cannot complete holds the checkpoint, and the Collection stays `syncing`. After
`REPLICA_CHUNK_PULL_RETRY_LIMIT` consecutive cycles stuck on one feed document,
counted in memory and so restarted by a restart, the Collection stalls. The
stall clears on the first chunk pull that passes. A request that fails inside a
chunk pull stalls that Collection rather than ending the cycle. A reader of the
status treats a reason it does not recognize as stalled for an unrecognized
reason.

A request to the peer that fails outside a chunk pull, a 404 for the Space
included, ends the cycle. The loop then backs off, doubling its delay up to a
limit, and logs one `warn` when the failures begin. Nothing stops a loop but the
removal of its registration. The manager stops every loop in the same `onClose`
hook that closes the backend, ahead of it.

## Transport

`sync/peerFetch.ts` is the transport. `fromSpace` is a URL the controller
supplies, so every request to it is bound as the peer log fetch is (see
`lib/peerWebvh.ts` in [webvh-controllers.md](webvh-controllers.md)): `https`
only, the default port, no redirect followed, and a connection only to the
public addresses checked after DNS. The plugin's `peerFetch` option replaces it
in tests.

The feed has a read-only form for the loop,
`GET /space/:spaceId/:collectionId/query?profile=changes`, with `checkpoint` and
`limit` in the query string, verified under the `GET` action. The `POST` form
needs a `POST` capability, which a pull capability does not carry.
