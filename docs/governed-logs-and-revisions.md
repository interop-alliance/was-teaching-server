# Governing History Logs and the Revisions Descriptor

This document covers the `governed-history-logs` feature (a Collection's
governing history log), the `encryption` and `revisions` descriptors derived
from it, the cache that memoizes that derivation, the Collection `revisions`
descriptor with its write-once rule, and the checks Import applies to both.
[ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) holds the layer map and the glossary.

## The governing log

`src/lib/governedLog.ts` implements the `governed-history-logs` feature: a
Collection's governing history log, served at its own sub-resource
(`GET`/`PUT /space/:spaceId/:collectionId/meta/log`, `CollectionRequest.getLog`
/ `putLog`).

The log is not a Resource. It is absent from listings, exempt from the
encrypted-Collection envelope rule, and left untouched by a `PUT /meta`. The
[changes feed](changes-feed.md) carries it as its own `log` document, apart from
the Resources.

It is served as `text/jsonl` with its own `ETag`, from its generation and write
stamp (see [validators-and-stamps.md](validators-and-stamps.md)), so a
conditional `GET` behaves like any other record. A `PUT` is either a guarded
create (`If-None-Match: *`) or a compare-and-swap append (`If-Match` carrying
the prior bytes verbatim plus one new line), 412 on a lost race.

`GET` is capability-or-policy at the Collection's target. `PUT` is
capability-only, like `/meta`, and carries the same container rule as `/meta`
(see [client-annex-clause.md](client-annex-clause.md)): a direct root
invocation, or a delegated capability whose tail targets exactly the Space's
canonical trailing-slash URL.

## Guarded create

The guarded create is the declaration that puts the Collection under log
governance. It is refused with `encryption-immutable` (409) on a Collection
whose Metadata object already carries a client-written `encryption` member, or a
`plaintext` member. The derived `encryption` and a stored `plaintext` would
exclude each other on every later Metadata write, and `plaintext` has no removal
path.

## Derived descriptors

From then on, the Collection's served `encryption` member is derived from the
log's last line's `state`. It is read by Get Collection and by every handler
that loads the Collection Metadata object through `getCollectionOrThrow`, so the
write-time envelope check sees it too.

A `history: { method, resource }` member is always stamped on. `method` comes
from the genesis line's `parameters.method`, and `resource` is the log's own
URL. The stored Collection Metadata object never carries that derived member. A
direct `encryption` write against it is refused with
`encryption-history-log-governed` (409), and its other fields still update
normally.

The `state` has one reserved slot, `revisions`. It is taken out of the derived
`encryption` member and served as the Collection's `revisions` member instead,
replacing any stored one.

A direct `revisions` write on a governed Collection is checked against the
derived descriptor and is not stored. A body `merge` that differs from the
derived one is refused with `revisions-immutable` (409, pointer
`#/revisions/merge`). Omitting `merge` or restating the derived one passes. The
stored `revisions` member is carried forward untouched by such a write. The
guarded create may move a member off its default, but may not change one the
stored object sets to another value (`revisions-immutable`, 409).

The derivation is memoized per backend by the log's validator (see
[The descriptor cache](#the-descriptor-cache)). Update Collection's recheck
under the lock derives from the log the backend hands its `assertTransition`
callback, so a Metadata write parses the log at most once.

## Log writes

The server verifies neither proofs nor a hash chain. It checks that the body is
JSON Lines, each line a JSON object with an object `state` member and the last
line the head. It also checks that the genesis line's `parameters` carries a
string `method`, and that no line's `state` carries a `history` member, since
the server stamps that member itself. A break of any of these is
`invalid-request-body` (400).

It also checks that an append fast-forwards the stored log. The body must be the
stored bytes verbatim followed by exactly one new line. A body the stored log is
not a prefix of is `precondition-failed` (412), with or without `If-Match`. A
body adding more than one line is `invalid-request-body` (400).

A body equal to the stored log byte for byte is a no-op. Once its preconditions
pass, it answers 204 with the current `ETag` and writes nothing, so neither the
log's `ETag` nor the Collection Metadata object's moves. A body that is a strict
prefix of the stored log would erase lines and stays a 412.

On every append the server runs the same `encryption` and `revisions` transition
checks against the prior head that an ordinary Collection Metadata update runs.
It also checks the shape of the head's `revisions` slot. The fast-forward rule
keeps the log append-only at the server: a write capability can add history but
not erase it, while a break inside an appended entry stays the verifying
reader's to detect.

A log write mints the log's own stamp. It also advances the Collection Metadata
object's local segment, since the object's served content changed, and leaves
that object's stamp untouched, `updatedAt` included. It is serialized with
Collection Metadata writes through the same per-Collection lock.

## The descriptor cache

`src/lib/governedDescriptorsCache.ts` is a read cache, one per storage backend.
It memoizes the `encryption` and `revisions` descriptors derived from a
log-governed Collection's history log. The parse is what it saves, since the log
is append-only and grows. The log body is still read on each request.

An entry is keyed by Collection and by the log's own four-segment `ETag`, so a
log write leaves the old key behind and the next derivation misses on a new one.
It therefore carries none of the multi-instance staleness that the Space
Metadata and policy caches carry (see [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)).

Delete Collection, Delete Space, and Import Space drop entries by prefix.
Entries expire after 600 s and are capped at 1000
(`GOVERNED_DESCRIPTORS_CACHE_TTL`, `GOVERNED_DESCRIPTORS_CACHE_MAX`).

## The revisions descriptor

`src/lib/revisions.ts` holds the Collection `revisions` descriptor: `resolution`
(a closed set, `last-writer-wins` only, which is also the default), `immutable`
(a boolean, default `false`), and `merge` (an object the server stores and
serves verbatim and does not read).

It holds the shape check, which refuses an unknown `resolution` (the reserved
`keep-conflicts` included), a wrong member type, and an unknown member as
`invalid-request-body` (400).

It holds the transition check. `resolution` and `immutable` are declared by the
write that creates the Collection (a Create Collection `POST`, a create by
`PUT .../meta`, or a governing log's guarded create) and are immutable
afterward. An absent member stands for its default, and members are compared by
the value they stand for. Restating a default, or dropping an explicit default,
passes. Setting `immutable: true` on an existing Collection, or dropping or
changing a set `immutable: true`, is refused with `revisions-immutable` (409).
So a full replacement that omits a set `immutable: true` is refused, as one that
omits a set `encryption` is. A governing log's guarded create may move a member
off its default, but may not change one set to another value. `merge` follows
the body.

The module also holds the split of a governing log's `state` into its
`encryption` and `revisions` parts, and the write-once rule.

## The write-once rule

The rule is decided in two ways. A handler that read the Collection as
write-once passes `immutable: true` to the backend. Otherwise it passes a
recheck callback as `immutable` (built by `writeOnceOptions` in
`requests/collectionContext.ts`). Over a live Resource or chunk, the backend
calls it inside the write's critical section with the governing history log it
reads there.

A log's guarded create is the one write that can declare `immutable` on an
existing Collection. In the filesystem backend, a log write that may create the
log runs on the exclusive side of the Space gate, so it cannot land between a
write's log read and its bytes. An append stays on the shared side. In the
Postgres backend, the recheck reads the log under the `collections` row lock a
log write takes. See [filesystem-layout.md](filesystem-layout.md) for the gate.

Inside the critical section, after its preconditions pass, the backend compares
a write over a live Resource or chunk with the stored representation. The media
type is compared without its parameters and case-insensitively, so a retry that
adds `; charset=utf-8` is still a repeat. Bytes are compared exactly, a JSON
body as the `JSON.stringify` serialization both backends store, so a different
key order is a different body. The filesystem backend compares the stored size
first, then JSON bytes directly or a SHA-256 of a binary body read through the
upload cap. An over-cap body answers `payload-too-large` (413), as a write
would.

A repeat is a no-op answering the stored `ETag`, with no new stamp and no feed
position. A byte-identical repeat over a live Resource or chunk whose sidecar
carries no validator stamps the sidecar and answers the new `ETag`. Any other
write is refused with `resource-immutable` (409).

A filesystem representation file no sidecar names is a write torn between its
bytes and its sidecar, which never committed. It is not a stored Resource or
chunk, so a write over it is a create, whatever its body.

Both backends decide the rule before the unique-claim scans (blinded `unique`
attributes and `unique` plaintext indexes). A write the rule answers runs no
Collection scan, and a changed body that also collides answers
`resource-immutable`. A tombstone keeps no bytes, so a write over one is an
ordinary create.

Delete, Resource `/meta` writes, and imports are not restricted. An import is
skip-not-overwrite, so it never changes a stored Resource, and an archived body
that differs from a stored one is skipped rather than refused. The rule holds on
plaintext and encrypted Collections alike, and on a `did.jsonl`, whose append is
an update.

## Import checks

Import checks the descriptor too (see [export-import.md](export-import.md)). The
plan builder (`lib/importTar.ts`) runs the shape check on an archived Collection
Metadata object's `revisions` member. When the archive also carries the
Collection's governing log, it requires the log head's `revisions` slot to keep
what the archived object sets (the guarded-create check). A break of either
refuses the import as `invalid-import` (400).
